## Cyclistic Bike-Share Data Analysis

In this case study, I analyzed Cyclisticâ€™s bike usage data to identify key differences between casual riders (who use single-ride or full-day passes) and annual members (who have yearly subscriptions). Through data preparation and analysis, I discovered that casual riders have significantly longer ride durations, as compared to annual members across all days of the week.
