## Projects

In this section you can find short summary of the listed projects for quick comprehension. 

### [Cyclistic Bike-Share Data Analysis](https://github.com/RosemaryOjwang/Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Data-Analysis)

In this case study, I analyzed Cyclistic’s bike usage data to explore the behavior differences between casual riders (who use single-ride or full-day passes) and annual members (with yearly subscriptions). My process involved preparing and cleaning the data, followed by detailed analysis to uncover patterns in usage. I discovered that casual riders, on average, have significantly longer ride durations than annual members, and this trend holds true across all days of the week. These insights provide valuable context for targeting marketing efforts to each rider group.
